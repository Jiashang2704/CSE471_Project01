Example of score file note:
<note measure="1" beat="1" duration="2" speed="0.5" note="C2" pedal="0"/>

Elements:
1,Polyphony:
Piano notes can be played in the sametime if they have the same "measure" and "beat" variables in note object. 
Note variable can be set as formats like "A4" or "F4#", the # sign is going after the numbers.

2,Envelopes:
The piano note will have a long dampening period when key is released. The duration variable determines the length of time from pressing key to release.

3,Pedals:
Pedal variable can be set to "0", "1", "2", "3". When pedal was set to "1", "2", and "3", it was pressing the pedal:
"0": No pedal in use.
"1": Stepping down to pedal. creating pedal down sound.
"2": Pedal is in used and pressing, no sound will be produced.
"3": Pedal is releasing, creating pedal up sound.

4,Dynamics (basic):
The speed variable can determine the volumn/loudness of a piano note sound, range 0 to 1, from zero amplitude to the amplitude of the loud version of the piano note

5,Pedal Noise:
See 3 in detail, pedal noise can be make when setting to "1" or "3" for press and release. The two sounds are implemented and loaded in class CPianoInstrument.

6,Dynamics (advanced):
There are sources of sound in class CPianoInstrument. There are loud version and soft version of the piano sounds. They are interpolated each other.
When speed variable is set to 1, it will be pure loud sound and when it is near to 0, it will be very close to the soft sound.
When speed variable is set to 0.5, it will be a half-half mixture of soft and loud sound.
